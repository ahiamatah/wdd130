        <div id="about-3">
            <p class="ap1">Portrait photographers have been at the vanguard of the photography craft. They’ve documented some of history’s most famous and infamous individuals. And they brought photography into the mainstream. Portrait photography has given us the protagonists of our shared history. They’ve connected us to presidents, prime ministers, and stars on the stage and screen. Their portraits are hung in prominent galleries all over the world. And they’ve graced the covers of Time, Vogue, and Rolling Stone. These faces have become part of public consciousness. But portrait photography isn’t just about the big names. Portraits are about people. And portrait photographers use their cameras to tell personal stories. They capture the spirit of the people they encounter, from farmers to fishermen and businessmen to bandits. As well as being a discipline in its own right, portrait photography is a feature in many types of photography. Portraits play a significant role in fashion and editorial photography. And you’ll find portraits everywhere, from photojournalism to wedding photography. Portrait photography endures because we love characters. We want to know the players in the stories humans tell. And the best portrait photographers let us glimpse hearts and souls laid bare on celluloid. Portrait photography allows us to connect with people we may never know.</p>
